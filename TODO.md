## Setup

*   Please add yourself to the contributors field in `package.json` if I didn't
    already
    *   Also to the author meta tag in index.html if I didn't already add you there
        too
*   If you are not familiar with JS, please become familiar with it
    *   Look for the most recent information about ES6/ES2015
*   Also Sass/SCSS and HTML, but there's probably not too much of this for this
    game
*   If you have not settled on a text editor yet, use [Atom][]!

## Dev

*   Come up with an idea
*   Rename the repo something more meaningful
*   Make the game :D

## Other things

*   Do we want unit tests?
*   Figure out a branching strategy for Git. Probably should make PR's before
    merging into master
